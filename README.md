These are the codes and datasetsfor Yue Wang and Ziting Yuan's final paper for machine learning. 
Please checkit carefully.
The package "data" contains the original data downloaded from kaggel https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/brats2020-training-data/data?select=BraTS20+Training+Metadata.csv
The package "Dataset" contains washed and integrated data from "data" and training figures (measures such as hausdorff95).
The package "StateDict" contains .pth files as the statedictionary for the model.
See the above three packages on quarkcloud(夸克云),since they are too large to be posted on github. The link is give as follow
